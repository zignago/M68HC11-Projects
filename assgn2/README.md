## LAB Assignment #2 
### Due date: Wednesday, September 29, before 2:00 pm. 

You are to design, write, assemble, and simulate an assembly language program which will multiply 
two 8-bit numbers, NUM1 and NUM2, by adding NUM1 to itself NUM2 times. Both of these numbers 
are UNSIGNED (non-negative) numbers. The result will be a 16-bit number to be stored in RESULT 
in BIG-ENDIAN format. For example, your numbers could be 255 and 255, and the product would 
then be 65025 = $FE01 (in hex).
